# Hi. I am at Shenzhen right now.
# Too bad I didn't know Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google are all banned in China.
# Nothing I can do without those services, but luckily github works.
# But again, I forgot to push my progress to master before I left for China
# Guess I'll have to re-do stuff from scratch here.
# Between Professors, Assistant Professors, and Graudate students who all know each other well
# There is no place for trifle undergraduate.
# So awkward lol
